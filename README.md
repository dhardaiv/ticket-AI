# PPO Ticket Delegation Agent ðŸŽ«ðŸ¤–

> **Status:** ðŸš§ *This project is still in progress*  

This repository contains a **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent** designed to **automatically delegate tickets to the most suitable team** based on ticket features and historical performance. The goal is to optimize workload distribution while minimizing SLA breaches and improving resolution efficiency.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Custom Gymnasium Environment** â€“ Simulates a ticketing system with teams, tickets, priorities, and SLA rules.  
- **PPO Agent (Stable-Baselines3)** â€“ Reinforcement learning agent that learns optimal delegation policies.  
- **Reward Function** â€“ Configurable design to balance between SLA compliance, resolution efficiency, and fairness across teams.  
- **Flexible Inputs** â€“ Accepts structured ticket data (e.g., features like priority, type, category).  
- **Logging & Evaluation** â€“ Training logs, performance metrics, and model checkpoints included.
